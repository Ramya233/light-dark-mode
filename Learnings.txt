What did you learn in this project ?

1) Color pallets, contrast, etc -> article
2) Colors are set
3) set a background pattern from hero patterns -> adjust colors 
4) make all the html and clicking on the navigation should get to that pattern
   simple, just add the section name in the href of the anchor tag.
5) custome google fonts
6)undram illustrations for the second section -> you will have to have 
 2 version of the image, dark and light
7) font awesome for social media icons

--------------------------------Javascript----------------------------
1)select -> input[type="checkbox"],  
2)See how to check all the events in the event listeners
  you can always console.log(e) to see the events
3) make a function switchTheme()
4) event.target.checked -> true/false -> when it is true we want our
when the boolean is checked we want our dark mode, when unchecked we
want the light mode.
5) In css we had 2 different sets of colors -> 
  when our data-theme is set to dark we are switching to different colors

6) To do the above -> we will have to set that attribute to the highest
  level of our html (mozilla -> Document.documentElement) returns the 
  element that is the root element of the document (the html element for html documents)
  
  we have to set the attribute of the dark theme on that element

  document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark');
  else ('light')

7)Now everything has changed in color -> only a few things haven't
  Now we'll manually change everything that hasn't 
  -> we make constants for everything that has to change

 -> nav, toggle-icon,images, tex-box js elements 

 -> Now we need 2 different functions darkmode() and lightmode() 
    within the switchTheme(so the few things that haven't changed also change)

8)create 2 functions lightmode and darkmode
  console.log(toggleIcon.children)
  Also add the function that changes the colors of the image in the 
  darkmode and lightmode respectively

9)Make a function called imageColor() that changes the color of the image
  when in dark mode

10) Now you will see that when you switch the mode -> you are still seeing
   that dark mode written and the dark mode images 
   for this we create lightmode function


11) Now we add local storage data -> it allows you to store data between 
   sessions , when you turn off your computer and come back a week later
   your local storage data will still be there.

   we set a value and then get a value
    localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');
  
  const currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
  console.log(currentTheme); -> null (to address this we need to have something
  in default)

  Now at some point we have stored the dark theme in the local storage,
  but after refreshing we are still getting the light mode.

  so we use the if statements and say -> if that mode exists then set the
  theme.
